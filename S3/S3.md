# Simple Storage
- S3 (AWS) = BLOB Storage (Azure) = Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

## Establishing connection to S3
- Create .aws folder
- Create config file (region)
- credentials file (enviromeent varibales)
- Include [default] at top of file
- Save

## Buckets are storages (are like containers we can chuck data into)
- (work a bit like a nosql database, not too structured)
- Buckets can have folders and different file types

### Inside buckets are objects

## Client (boto3.client('s3'))
- A low level, service specific interface
- Requires more manual work
- Faster and lighter
- Represnts data in dicts

## Resource (boto3.resource('s3'))
- A high level object orietned interface
- More pythonic and abstracted
- Easier to work with
- Uses objects like Bucket, Object instead of raw dicts
